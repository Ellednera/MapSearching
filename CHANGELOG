28 MAY 2021
- Changed the constructor of Station to public
- Add synopses for some of the Station and CityMap classes
- Made minor corrections to README

26 MAY 2021
- Created the jar file assets v1.0.0

25 MAY 2021
- Corrected the top left corner of the map a little bit, the CSP should work better by now

21 MAY 2021
- Added the benchmarking codes for CSP and COP

20 MAY 2021
- Added more stations and changed some colors
- Tweaked the GUI a little bit
- Added more description to TestScript::main

19 MAY 2021
- Add all the listeners needed for the GUI components.
- The screen can now paint the chosen path determined by the algorithm
- Rearranged the remote comtrol's components :)
- Moved the screen dimension into Screen, so no more setting the screen size manually
- Fixed the CSP algorithm, it is now showing the correct path (most likely)
- Updated the TestScript
- Changed the details of company station to cw with the name of CW

18 MAY 2021
- Modified the layout of the GUI a bit and added some more components
- Added the logic ie. event listeners for most of the components (buttons, text field, list)

17 MAY 2021
- Overloaded GPS::findChosenPath. The original version is used to check ONLY the starting station and the destination station. 
  The newer version is used to look for the path that includes the extra stations in between.
  *Take note: GPS::findChosenPath WITH capacity utilizes the CSP concept, will return null if the selected path is not valid
              GPS::findChosenPath WITHOUT capacity utilizes the COP concept 
- Modified the display of the map and relocated quite some stations
- Added more stuff to the gui (remote control)
- CityMap::createBridges for 3 stations in one go is not longer available due to some unexpected bridge issues that might occur
- Due to new stations and connections added, CityMap::processFullNetwork's number of layers should be set to 5
- TestScript is now more readable :)

7 MAY 2021
- CityMap::showAvailablePaths now supports checking against capacity
- Changed Station::toString's return value to resemble the Cartesian coordinates
- Some more stations were connected in the map by default
- Screen now displays the distance between stations

5 MAY 2021
- This was forked into JADE-Cars as some codes in the original MapSearching has been edited to suite the whole project in Eclipse
- On packaging the codes:
  1. Station, CityMap, GPS and Screen were packaged under "assets" namespace.
  2. TestScript.java was left out to be the general script to run and test all the assets
- Solved the problem with screen going blank after reopening the minimized gui window(if it appears blank, click the screen)
- Moved the Screen class into another file, Eclipse was complaining about that :)
  - Added MouseListener and MouseAdapter to Screen
- Screen::sendStationList was redefined as Screen::sendMap()
- Successfully intergrated CityMap and GPS into MasterRoutingAgent in setup()

1 MAY 2021
- Refactored the codes in GPS::findChosenPath with the following sub-methods:
  1. GPS::correctedDirection
  2. GPS::schwartzianTransform
- Added a route direction checking feature (only applicable for GPS::findChosenPath) due to the way paths are filtered
- The GPS screen is finally displaying the stations and the roads
- Coordinates of Stations in CityMap were changed to some values that makes sense :)


29 APRIL 2021
- Updated the followings:
  1. CityMap.java
  2. GPS.java
  3. TestScript.java
- Updated the documentation (README)


28 APRIL 2021 and beyond :)
- Updated Station.java and some other files
