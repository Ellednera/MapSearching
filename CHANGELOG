5 MAY 2021
- This was forked into JADE-Cars as some codes in the original MapSearching has been edited to suite the whole project in Eclipse
- On packaging the codes:
  1. Station, CityMap, GPS and Screen were packaged under "assets" namespace.
  2. TestScript.java was left out to be the general script to run and test all the assets
- Solved the problem with screen going blank after reopening the minimized gui window(if it appears blank, click the screen)
- Moved the Screen class into another file, Eclipse was complaining about that :)
  - Added MouseListener and MouseAdapter to Screen
- Screen::sendStationList was redefined as Screen::sendMap()
- Successfully intergrated CityMap and GPS into MasterRoutingAgent in setup()

1 MAY 2021
- Refactored the codes in GPS::findChosenPath with the following sub-methods:
  1. GPS::correctedDirection
  2. GPS::schwartzianTransform
- Added a route direction checking feature (only applicable for GPS::findChosenPath) due to the way paths are filtered
- The GPS screen is finally displaying the stations and the roads
- Coordinates of Stations in CityMap were changed to some values that makes sense :)


29 APRIL 2021
- Updated the followings:
  1. CityMap.java
  2. GPS.java
  3. TestScript.java
- Updated the documentation (README)


28 APRIL 2021 and beyond :)
